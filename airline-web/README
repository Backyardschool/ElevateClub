To properly setup emails need to download the gmail credentials json and authorize the account locally first

Then copy the credentials json and put it to `conf` folder with name `gmail-credentials.json` and copy the `tokens` to the app directory

Similarly the banner uses google oauth. Need to authorize locally by downloading the credentals json as `google-oauth-credentials.json` to conf folder.
Then invoke the main method of `GooglePhotoUtil`, watch console, it should give u a URL, click on it and it should bring you to authorize it. Afterwards copy the `google-tokens` to the app directory

For google map api (for image search from server)

set `google.apiKey` in `application.conf`
